Compiler Design Lab (18CS63) Programs (LAB TEST and SEE)

 Program 1: 
o Write a LEX program to count number of words, lines, characters and
whitespaces in a given paragraph.
o Write a YACC program to recognize strings of the form a n b n+m c m , n,m&gt;=0.

 Program 2:
o Write a LEX program to count number of Positive and Negative integers and
Positive &amp; Negative fractions.
o Write a YACC program to validate and evaluate a simple expression involving
operators +,- , * and /.

 Program 3:
o Write a LEX program to count the number of comment lines in a C Program. Also
eliminate them and copy that program into a separate file.
o Write a YACC program to recognize a nested (minimum3levels)FOR loop
statement for C language.

 Program 4:
o Write a LEX program to recognize and count the number of identifiers, operators
and keywords in a given input file.
o Write a YACC program to recognize nested IF control statements (C language)
and display the number of levels of nesting.

 Program 5: Write a YACC program to recognize Declaration statement (C language) and
display the number variables declared .
Variable can be any basic data type or array type
Example int a[10],a,b,c;

 Program 6: YACC program that reads the C statements for an input file and converts
them in quadruple three address intermediate code.

 Program 7: Write a YACC program that identifies the Function Definition of C language.

 Program 8: Write a YACC program that generates Assembly language (Target) Code for
valid Arithmetic Expression.
